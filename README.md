- **DATABASE** contains all the images used to train a parameter selection model on, images of; dogs, sheeps, horses and cows. It also contains images of butterflies, since these were used for some experiments. Additional to the images there are some util files to analyze images or edit them.
- **PARAMETER_SELECTION_MODEL** contains all model training files, these are XGBoost, neural network and one-shot learner trainers based on images, hidden layer representations or manually selected features per image.
- **PIPELINE** contains a pipeline of an executable version of the application, in wich the pipeline gives feedback to the parameter selection model such that it can gradually improve itself.
- **PIPELINE_CV** contains a cross-validation analysis on the segmentation parformance utilizing 'smart' parameters.
